# What's this web application？
**This is a web application designed to help English beginners look up word pronunciations.  
Currently, it only implements the pronunciation of words and sentences.  
In the future, I will gradually improve other features of the app, such as saving history records, adjusting sentence reading speed, etc.   
I hope it can be helpful for everyone's work and study.**

# How to use？
1. ```npm install```
2. ```npm start```
3. To modify or add the pronunciation language you desire, locate the file at `/src/Services/Languages/Languages.js`. You can adjust the `languages` object as needed.
